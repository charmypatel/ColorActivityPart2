# Pallete Activity (Using Multiple Activities)

**CIS 3515 Introduction to Mobile Application Development - Assignment 4**

This Android application is a 2-activity application along with a custom adapter. The application allows the user 
to select a color from a Spinner on one activity, and once selected, launch the second activity and set the background of 
the new activityâ€™s layout to the selected color. The first activity is called Pallete Activity and the second activity
is called Canvas Activity (this is the new activity that opens when a color is selected as shown in image 1 & 2 below).
The application also has a custom icon (the black and white icon shown in the third image) that I made and a signed APK
has been generate that is ready to be distributed.
